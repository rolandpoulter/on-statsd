on-statsd
==============
On-statsd wraps [etsy's statsD](https://github.com/etsy/statsd) and
furnishes it with a [config](./lib/config) file pointed where we expect 
there to be a graphite backend server. 


to see your stats
-----------------
Clone into [ansible-graphite](https://github.com/dmichel1/ansible-graphite) and in
ansible-graphite/roles/graphite/templates/opt/graphite/webapp/graphite/local_settings.py.j2
set the TIME_ZONE variable to your local time. Then vagrant up in the ansible-graphite
directory. Now if you run node on-statsd/index.js (make sure you run it on the same
host as the clients you want it to hear from or configure the clients accordingly) it will 
aggregate any stats it receives and periodically flush them to the graphite backend.
Configuration options, e.g. graphite host ip and flush interval 
are set in [the lib config file](./lib/config.js)
